# MRC 73: Increase of Referral Rewards For Capital

Proposal to increase of Referral Rewards for Capital to 3%, 5%, 10% & 15% tiers.

Update in the Capital V2 Smart Contracts the parameter for referral rewards based on the amount of capital provided.

- Deposited capital of 1 stETH = 3% referral reward.
- Deposited capital of 2.5 stETH = 5% referral reward.
- Deposited capital of 25 stETH = 10% referral reward.
- Deposited capital of 62.5 stETH = 15% referral reward.

Implementated across the USDC, USDT, wETH, wBTC, and stETH capital pools.

MOR earned in the referral reward is unlocked. 
Reward tier is calculated based on virtual staked amount so the person doing the education about Moprheus is incentived to find capital providers who will chose to lock up their MOR claims a long time for a maximum reward multiple / highest virtual staked weight.
