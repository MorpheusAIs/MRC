# MRC 74: Establishing USDC Reserves For MRIs

Proposal to establish USDC reserves for MRIs in order to pay developers in stablecoins in addition to MOR.

This can be accomplished with the MRI maintainers selling MOR for USDC preferably via OTC trades (off market to diamond hands) in order to build up stable coin reserves.

Many developers can not wealthy and need USD or local currency income in order to pay their bills. 
So while rewarding Code contributors with MOR aligns them to the project, if they simply sell this MOR each month on the open market it has a negative effect and fails to align them anyway.

By having the MRI maintainers instead take on the sophisticated task finding diamond handed long term buyers and offering stablecoins to Code contributors if they select that option this will benefit the project.
