# MRC 72:

Proposal to change the "Claim Lock Minimum Time" from 90 Days to 7.

Implemented in the Capital V2 Smart Contracts. 

Once a provider of Capital (stETH, wETH, wBTC, USDC, USDT) deposits their capital they now only have to wait 7 days to claim their first MOR rewards.

Intent is to make Morpheus easier for new Capital providers to test out and see the rewards from.
