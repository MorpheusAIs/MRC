# MRC 58: Specification for the Agent Registry Smart Contract

## Introduction: Purpose and History
Originally the Agent Registry was included in the Morpheus / Lumerin Router along side the model registry. 
Due to the added complexity and the decision was made to set the Agent Registry as a stand along Smart Contract.
The following are required, optional, and calculated fields for the design of the Smart Contract.

## Agent Builders
Agent Builders will interact with the Smart Contract by publishing the records related to their Agent to the Registry.
The address that publishes the information to the Registry will be the sole entity that can edit the information as connected to their Base address.

## Chain
The Agent Registry will be published on Base.
