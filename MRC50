# Title: Initializing the Morpheus Builder Accelerator
### Author: Kevin 

#### Description

The Morpheus Builder Accelerator aims to attract and connect more builders toward the Techno Capital Machine (MRI 4). 
These tools will be open source and available to anyone who wants to help launch AI Agents and empower builders to use Morpheus.

## The initialization of the Morpheus Builder Accelerator will focus on the following set of deliverables:

1. Program Design - Work with Morpheus contributors to design an ideal accelerator program
2. Website - Develop and deploy a mission-specific website
3. Events - Attend hackathons and conferences to engage with developers and begin to socialize the program

#### Accelerator Program Design
Program Design encompasses all of the activities to align an accelerator to Morpheus values, capital, code and compute.

1. Meet with core contributors across capital, code, and compute to onboard to Morpheus and understand how each stakeholder might collaborate with the accelerator
2. Maintain a Notion that includes a project plan, a task board, and a location to store deliverables
3. Design the accelerator to accommodate all personas, including builders, capital providers, MRI coders, and compute providers
4. Design the accelerator to support builders as the primary stakeholders and enable them to be successful
5. Develop a set of builder use cases that assist builders with identifying potential solutions 
6. Explore MOR20 and assess it as the primary funding mechanism for the accelerator

##### Accelerator Website
Create an MVP website that can support initializing the Morpheus Builder Accelerator:

1. Serve as a landing page for the Morpheus Builder Accelerator
2. Effectively communicate an initial mission and structure to iterate on
3. Effectively provide context to developers, including use cases and relevant dev tooling
4. Ensure consistent branding with the Morpheus brand guidelines and link out to source documentation where relevant

##### Builder Engagement

1. Attend DeAI Day: The Age of Agents | Permissionless 2024
2. Work towards attending additional events
3. Attend AMAs for the Morpheus Builder Accelerator
4. Use Morpheus community channels to attract builders to the project
