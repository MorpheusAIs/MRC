# MRC 77:
Proposal to develop example user personas for the MVM and Reference Implementation Agent.

## MVM User Persona Examples:
- The "AI Agency Builder" persona can leverage the MVM for inference to power the solutions it builds for businesses.
- The Enterprise Eddy persona works inside an enterprise and wants to lower the cost of inference and can use Morpheus to switch to an open source alternative.

## Reference Implementation Agent Persona Examples
- The Alice the Agent Builder persona wants to create a more powerful Agent and can access the MVM for the Agentic Tools Marketplace and uses the reference implemtation to make her integration easy.
