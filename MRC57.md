# MRC 57: Best Practice For Stages Of Deployment Of A New Morpheus Reference Implementation Version

## Recommendation for Improved Flow / Moving Community Feedback / Testing To Earlier
Previously the flow of upgrades has been to design, code, test, audit and then enter community testing before deployment.
However this has led to several examples of when a deployment is passed audits, however the community find issues after the fact right before deployment.
To avoid this I'd propose the community feedback & community testing steps be moved up right after the design stage and and coding internal testing respectively. 

## Stages of Development
- 1. Design a Version publish on Github.
- 2. Community feedback, final decision by maintainer.
- 3. Coding by selected Coder.
- 4. Internal Testing by Coder
- 5. Community Testing - final decision by maintainer
- 6. Final Audit.
- 7. Deployment of New Reference Implementation
