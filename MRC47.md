# MRC47 Distribution of Historical Builder Reward MOR Tokens Stored in the Smart Contract
## Authors: Smart Agents

## Context
- Since February 8th 2024 the MOR emissions for Builder Rewards have been building up in the Distribution Smart Contract. 
- As of September 28th 2024 a total of 790,891 MOR have been emitted and held in the Smart Contract.
- Statistics from https://morlord.com/ 
- When Builder Rewards go live, new emissions will start being rewarded to builders based on that Smart Contract logic.
- There is no existing proposal either in the white paper or elsewhere in Docs repo that addresses how to distribute these previous MOR held in the Smart Contract.

## Objective
Develop system for the distribution of Builder Reward MOR token that has been stored in the Smart Contracts since launch.

## Proposal Details
- Identify existing Frontend / User Facing Applications, Smart Agents, and other projects that qualify for these MOR tokens.
- Stake MOR Rewards for 18 months before becoming claimable.
- As MOR Rewards become claimable by Builders these are distributed over an 18 month period.
- Said another way MOR rewards will be distributed to Builders over 18 months and then all be claimable by month 36.
- This 36 month period is reflective of the real world 36 month average that has emerged for Capital & Coding Providers.

## Criteria and Logic For Builders Rewards Distributions
- Existing utility offered to Morpheus users beyond what has been contributed to the Reference Implementations.
- Examples: Mor.org, Morlord.com, Venice.AI, Lumerin Compute Dashboards, MORAgents Smart Agent Builder Tools.
- Ranked by usage by users. For example Mor.org is the top ranked Morpheus related website when you search for Morpheus on Google.
- Based on historical contributors to Community websites and applications before this MRC was created (to avoid gaming).
- Review utility to the Morpheus community across Smart Agent Builders, Compute Providers, Capital Providers, and Code Providers.
- Builder Contributions should be maintained during the 18 months of the lock period to be full earned.

## Tool for Distribution
Well developed tool for distribution of tokens over a defined time period.

## Coding
No new coding is required to implement this MRC. 

## Timing
The analysis should be complete before the Builder Rewards go live (which is anticipated to be at the same time as the Compute Rewards).
