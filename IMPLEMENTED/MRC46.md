**Status: IMPLEMENTED**

## Smart Contract Functions To Be Added
Add two new variables by updating the smart contract. 
- #1. claimLockPeriodAfterStake = 90 Days
- #2. claimLockPeriodAfterClaim = 90 Days

It will be set every time the user deposits stETH, will be counted as current time + 90 days (or other value that can be changed on the contract).
It will be set every time the user claims MOR, will be counted as current time + 90 days (or other value that can be changed on the contract).

## Purpose
To prevent farmers from depositing stETH and immediately claiming / dumping the MOR tokens earned as there is currently no MOR claim delay function.

Those depositing stETH over a longer period of time are adding value to the Protocol Owned Liquidity.
Those only depositing stETH to immediately sell MOR are just preforming an arbitrage and providing less to the community then they get in MOR rewards.

[Analysis of the onchain data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RrE3tnByYoy_oieJkq5CJ3tFWvENgo6RYT9sepWaeCY/edit?usp=sharing) indicates this change will not effect 90% of the Morpheus Capital Contributors. 
- Only 10% of people Claim MOR more often than once every 90 days.
- Only 3.4% of the Capital Contributors claim more than once a month.

## Implementation
Can be coded up by the Smart Contract developers that worked on the Capital Smart Contracts.
