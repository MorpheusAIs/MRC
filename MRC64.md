# MRC 64: Morpheus Virtual Machine (MVM)

Proposal to describe the Morpheus Infrastructure as: "The Morpheus Virtual Machine" or the "MVM" for short.

"The MVM built on the EVM" providers a clear and simple framework for describing the 3 core functions of Morpheus providing Inference, Agentic Tools and Data storage.

Previously the various elements of Morpheus have been hard for a new agent developer to Grok. By instead starting with the MVM as the description of the developer can understand its value clearly.

Namely that by deploying an Agent on Morpheus it can run on the MVM forever. The Agent has everything it needs to function from inference for its LLM, to access to Agentic tools, to storage of long term context and memories.
