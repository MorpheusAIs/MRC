# Morpheus Request for Comment (MRC #54)
## Title: Morpheus Compute Unit (MCU) Framework for Staking-Based Compute Allocation

## Abstract
This MRC proposes the creation of a Morpheus Compute Unit (MCU), a standardized metric to track and display compute resources earned by users through staking MOR tokens. Modeled after Venice.AI’s Venice Compute Unit (VCU) system, the MCU framework will transparently quantify compute power allocated to users based on their MOR stake, enabling decentralized access to Morpheus Network resources (e.g., AI inference, data storage, or transaction prioritization).

## Motivation

- Transparency: Users currently lack a clear, real-time metric to understand compute entitlements from staking MOR.
- Utility Alignment: Mirroring Venice.AI’s VCU success, MCUs create a direct link between stake size and resource access, incentivizing MOR adoption.
- Competitive Edge: A standardized compute unit positions Morpheus as a leader in decentralized resource economies, similar to Venice.AI’s dominance in private AI.

## Specification

## MCU Definition

1 MCU = 1 MOR staked per day.
Example: A user staking 1,000 MOR earns 1,000 MCUs daily.

## Compute Allocation

### MCUs grant access to:
- Access to AI/ML inference tasks on the Morpheus Decentralized Router.
- Resource costs denominated in MCU/hour (e.g., 100 MCU/hour for GPU access).

### Dashboard displaying:
- Real-time MCU balance.
- MCU burn rate per active service.
- Projected MCU exhaustion timelines.

### Implementation Details

### Smart Contracts

- Upgrade MOR staking contracts to track MCU accrual.
- Burn MCUs proportionally to resource usage.
- Daily MCU are consumed or they expire every day at 12 midnight UTC.

## Use Cases

- Developers: Spend MCUs to deploy AI models on Morpheus.
- Miners: Earn MOR by contributing hardware, with payouts tied to MCU demand.
- Stakers: “Rent out” unused MCUs to other users for passive income via their API.

## Stakeholder Impact

- MOR Holders: Increased utility drives demand for staking.
- Miners/Validators: Must honor MCU-based resource allocation.
- Developers: Simplified pricing model for infrastructure.

## Next Steps
Finalize MCU economic model (15 days).
Audit upgraded staking contracts (30 days).
Beta test with Morpheus Node operators (45 days).

## Summary
This MRC intentionally mirrors Venice.AI’s VCU framework while adapting to Morpheus’s decentralized infrastructure goals.
