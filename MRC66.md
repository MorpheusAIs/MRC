# MRC 66: Zion As The Next Morpheus Era

Proposal to use "Zion" as the naming for the New Era that includes the MVM and the Reference Implementation.

This naming is consistant with the themes of Morpheus where Zion is the city of freedom those building freedom tech are working toward building together.

This era is focused on delivering the Morpheus Virtual Machine and the Reference Implementation Freedom Agent.

## MVM:
- Inference router & marketplace (already delivered in previous eras)
- Agentic Tools Marketplace as described in MRC 60. https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/MRC60.md
- Data storage router and marketplace as described in MRC 62. https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/MRC62.md

## Reference Implementation Agent:
A user facing Agent that offers an example to Agent developers of how to integrate the compenents of the MVM.
Described in MRC 63. https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/MRC63.md
