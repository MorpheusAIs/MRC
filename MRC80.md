# MRC 80: Redesign of Mor.org

Proposal to redesign the Reference Morpheus website Mor.org to focus on the use of the Morpheus Virtual Machine.

Generally move the messaging from the "come build Morpheus" to a "come USE Morpheus" message to developers.

Website should retain the Dashboard for Capital, Code, Inference, and Builders but the main landing page needs to be focus on developers accessing the using the MVM.
