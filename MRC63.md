# MRC 63: Reference Implementation Agent 

Morpheus Smart Agents will benefit from the creation of a Reference Implementation of an Agent on Morpheus that utilizes the Inference, Agentic Tools and Data Marketplaces.

This can serve as an exmaple for developers of how to integration the Morpheus tools into the Agents they are building. 

By having a user facing real world application consuming Morpheus inference, accessing agentic tools, and storinng data the whole community gains a valuable way to test their integrations.
