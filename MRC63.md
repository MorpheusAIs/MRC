# MRC 63: Morpheus Reference Agent (MRA)

## Summary 
Morpheus Smart Agents will benefit from the creation of a Reference Implementation of an Agent on Morpheus that utilizes the MVM for its Inference, Agentic Tools and Data Marketplaces.

This can serve as an exmaple for developers of how to integration the Morpheus tools into the Agents they are building. 

By having a user facing real world application consuming Morpheus inference, accessing agentic tools, and storinng data the whole community gains a valuable way to test their integrations.

## FreeAI As The Reference Agent
The whole point of FreeAI is serve as a Morpheus Reference Agent to demo the MVM. Link: https://app.freeai.xyz/

Its a great way to demonstrate the Morpheus Inference Marketplace via the API Gateway and how it can power different Agents starting with those that are already part of the Morpheus builder community.
